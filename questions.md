# Questions

* Why are there so many projects that seemingly do similar tasks: QICK, QubiC, [ICARUS-Q](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02933), Qiskit Pulse...?

## Physics Behind Qubits

* What is *AAIS* in SimuQ and how to use it? Should I learn it?
* What are "decimated readouts" in QICK, and is it relevant?
* What is a "Drag" pulse (as defined in Qiskit) and is it useful? Why or why not?
* How much should I know/care about T1/T2 decay errors?
* What is Lindblad's equation?
* How relevant is [QUASAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11719) here?
* What is a Nyquist zone?

## Hardware Design

* Is high-level synthesis worth looking into?
* How to use cocotb?
