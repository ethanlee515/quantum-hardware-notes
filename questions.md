## Physics Behind Qubits

* How does reflection from a cavity pick up a phase offset?
	* Shown in Equation 12.104 in the Steck quantum optics textbook
	* In Equation 373 of [these lecture notes](https://www.carlosnb.com/_files/ugd/b99da1_fa5355be38c448aca09f1584d705c52a.pdf) too
* In the Heisenberg picture, what is the annihilation operator doing operationally? Is it measuring which coherent state the system is in? Does it matter that the number of eigenstates here is uncountable?
* What is Rabi oscillation?
* What is the lamb shift? Is it related to AC Stark shift?
* What is Lindblad's equation?
* Why is the spacial coordinate dependence dropped in cavity calculations?
